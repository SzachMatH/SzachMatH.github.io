A simple list of projects I've done so far. I have only recently saw how much dopamine one gets from pursuing projects, earlier focusing on just acquisition of knowledge and doing simple exercises.

I will try to keep these projects by finish time, but for some this is a bad idea in my opinion, since most of work was done between two listed.
