This is a subpage where I list books that I read/am planning to read **and think are worth sharing**. Some of the books that I read will be ommmited in this section, so talk to me in person if you'd like to know what is missing from this list!

**If you'd like to read one of the non-ficiton books with me, that I've not read so far, I'd love to get in touch and make small seminar website, where we discuss what we read and learn from each other**

**Treat this subpage as my invitiation for collaborative learning with you.** I belive it's easier to stay consistent when pursuing project with a group and it's generally much more fun.
