# Welcome to my blog!

My name is Bartosz Szachniewicz. I am a bachellor of mathematics and am currently studying Computer science at University of Wroclaw. 

## What will this blog be about?

We will see :)

I think I'd like to blog about things that interest me - that being mathematics, computer science and cooking. Sometimes I'll learn about a cool topic that I think is particulary interesting (like fermenting my kimchi, derived functors in homological algebra or some cool data structure). This is a place to write about such topic. Maybe I'll also post about sports, like windsurfing, bouldering or weightlifting? 

## Why is this blog in english?

My goal is to share my interests with everyone. Since more people speak english than polish I'll stick with english, but some posts will propably be written in polish/both.
